# Unity Exercises

## Overview
This Unity project comprises three scenes designed to practice and explore different aspects of Unity development: "Lighting," "Particle System," and "Playground."

## Scene 1: Lighting

- **Objective:** Practice concepts related to lighting using point lights and spotlights.
- **Implementation:**
   - Experiment with point lights and spotlights to illuminate the scene.
   - Explore the impact of different light settings on the environment.
   - Adjust light intensity, color, and range to achieve desired effects.

## Scene 2: Particle System

- **Objective:** Introduction to particle systems using two methods:
   - Utilizing pre-defined assets from the Unity Store.
   - Creating particles from scratch within Unity.
- **Implementation:**
   - Experiment with pre-made particle assets to understand their behavior and customization options.
   - Create custom particle systems from scratch to achieve specific visual effects.
   - Explore different parameters such as emission rate, lifetime, size, and color.

## Scene 3: Playground

- **Objective:** A playground environment to implement various Unity features.
- **Implementation:**
   - Utilize the Unity Store's Third Person Character Controller as a starter asset.
   - Replace the armature with a new one from Mixamo to customize the character.
   - Experiment with different skybox settings to change the environment's atmosphere.
   - Implement a video on a plane using the "Video Player" component.

- This project was developed as part of a virtual reality (VR) training program [The Interactive Digital Center (IDC)](https://eonreality.com/locations/ben-guerir-ma/#:~:text=in%20their%20sector.-,VR%20Innovation%20Academy,-COMPREHENSIVE%20CURRICULUM). The goal of the training was to apply and reinforce various Unity concepts, including 3D environment design, asset integration, scripting and UI integration with VR and AR functionality.
